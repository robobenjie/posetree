"""
`posetree` is a module for representing and manipulating poses in 3D space. There are two main classes: `Pose` and `PoseTree`.

A `Pose` is an immutable location and orientation in 3D space, relative to a frame (i.e. 1 meter forward in X from the robot base).

A `PoseTree` is a object that keeps track of frames as they change over time, so that poses can know how to transform themselves into other frames, 
and do math operations with poses in different frames at particular points in time. You will need to subclass PoseTree to hook it up to your robot's
odometry system.

    A Pose is an immutable location and orientation in 3D space.
    A pose is defined with a `parent_frame` (where to start) and a transform (how to get to the pose from the parent frame).

    Note: While a Pose is immutable, the parent frame can (and does!) change over time relative to other frames, meaning that an individual pose can move relative
    to other frames. (For example a pose defined in the "robot" frame will conceptually move as the robot moves relative to a 'world'
    frame, even though its position and orientation remain immutably constant.)
